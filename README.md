# AI-Project
This project consists of utilising AI models to distinguish wether a berry is edible or not using images.
# How Is Done
I used a convolutional neural network known as Alexnet; and using multimple images of berries, both toxic and edible, i trained it to distinguish the two possible outcomes to a 98% accuaracy rate.

This project consists of utilising AI models to distinguish wether a berry is edible or not using images.

### How Is Done
I used a convolutional neural network known as Alexnet; and using multimple images of berries, both toxic and edible, i trained it to distinguish the two possible outcomes to a 98% accuaracy rate.

### what exactly is Alexnet
AlexNet is a convolutional neural network that is 8 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals.

Basically, the "CNN" takes an imput of an image and runs it throught 5 fiters from which it extracts certain cues from the image which then are used to detarmine what image is being used.

### Meaning behind this project
Utiizing berries to determine wether you can eat them or not its just an example of what the program can do. This model could be used by anyone to determine wether the food they are thinking about consuming is edible or not.

The program can be trained to differentiate mold on food, raw unedible and edibe meat, etc.
